subheading: The Netlify Image CDN brings the ability to automatically optimize local and remote images.

import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import corgi from '../../assets/corgi.jpg';

## Using the built-in Astro image component

Astro's `<Image />` component will automatically use Netlify Image CDN to serve optimized images.

```astro
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import corgi from '../assets/corgi.jpg';
---

<Image src={corgi} alt="Corgi" /* ... additional props */ />
```

## Original vs. optimized image: can you tell the difference?

A regular `<img />` tag is shown below to demonstrate a framework-agnostic example.

```html
<!-- Left: the original image -->
<img src="/images/corgi.jpg" alt="Corgi" />

<!-- Right: using Netlify Image CDN endpoint for a responsive image -->
<img srcset="${sampleImageSrcSet}" sizes="${sizes}" alt="Corgi" />
```

## Local development

TODO

## unpic-img

Aside from Astro's `Image` or rolling your own `<img />` tags, you can also use the excellent [unpic-img](https://unpic.pics/) package.
